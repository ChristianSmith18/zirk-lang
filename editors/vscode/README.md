# Zirk Language Support

VS Code extension offering syntax highlighting and basic language configuration for the Zirk programming language.

## Features

- **Full Syntax Highlighting:** Covers the entire Zirk language specification including keywords, operators, decorators (`@test`, `@e2e`, `@bench`), variables, types, and strings (with escape sequence support and string interpolation).
- **Auto-Closing Pairs:** Automatic completion of curly braces `{}`, square brackets `[]`, parentheses `()`, and quotation marks `""`.
- **Comment Toggling:** Standard toggle for line comments (`//`) and block comments (`/* ... */`).

## Installation for Local Testing

To test the extension locally in VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or any other VS Code fork:

### Option A: Install via symlink (recommended for development)

1. Create a symlink to the `editors/vscode` directory inside your VS Code extension folder:
   ```bash
   ln -s "/Users/cristian/Projects/PROPIOS/zirk-lang-syntax/editors/vscode" ~/.vscode/extensions/zirk-lang
   ```
2. Restart your editor (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.).
3. Open any file with `.zrk` extension (like the corpus examples).

### Option B: Build a portable `.vsix` package

1. Install the VS Code extension manager globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @vscode/vsce
   ```
2. Run the packaging command from the extension folder (`editors/vscode`):
   ```bash
   cd editors/vscode
   vsce package
   ```
3. Install the generated `.vsix` file in your editor via the command palette (`Developer: Install Extension from VSIX...`).
